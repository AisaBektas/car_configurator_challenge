Car configurator challenge

`Vite js` consists of a dev server that bundles code for production. 
Vite.js allows developers to set up a development environment for frameworks like Vue, TezJS and React and even for Vanilla JavaScript app with a dev server. 
It offers a fast and opinionated build tool out of the box with highly customizable API using plugins.

`React` is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. One of the most popular tools for building `SPA` in the world.

`Context API` provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. 
Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

`MUI` is a massive library of UI components designers and developers can use to build React applications. 
The open-source project follows Googleâ€™s guidelines for creating components, giving you a customizable library of foundational and advanced UI elements.
